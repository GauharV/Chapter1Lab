## Reflection Question
1.The most challenging part was figuring out what was the right syntaax and fuction names.  

2.I used ai when I didn't understand why my syntax wasn't going through I was forgetting certain brackets  

3. I don't really like coding.(I was booted from Networking to Computer programing without a choice)
However, there was one thing I like more in java than python it was more in depth so I understood why the code did what it did.
